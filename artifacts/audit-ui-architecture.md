# Deep Audit Report: UI & Architecture Alignment

## 1. Objective

This document summarizes the findings from the deep audit of the Pawvels codebase (`apps/web`) against the Product Requirements Document (`prd.md`), technical architecture (`ARCHITECTURE.md`), and strict project mandates (`GEMINI.md` / `CLAUDE.md`). It also defines the strategic roadmap for the upcoming development phases.

## 2. Audit Findings

### 2.1. UI & Mandate Compliance (Status: 100% Aligned)

The execution of the "Front-end First" strategy has been highly successful. All strict UI mandates have been strictly followed:

- **Bottom Navigation**: Strictly maintains 4 tabs (Home, Produk, Booking, Akun). Cart access is properly routed to the header.
- **Header**: The account icon has been correctly omitted. It exclusively features the Location row, Notifications (Bell), and Cart.
- **Footer**: Properly disabled/removed from the `ShopLayout` for mobile-first infinite scroll feel.
- **Branding Integration**: The Salmon-Orange (`#E07B39` / `rgba(224, 123, 57, 0.3)`) aesthetic is consistently applied to borders (Search Bar, Category Chips, Action Cards) across the application.
- **3D Carousel Stack**: The custom piece-wise stacking algorithm (`useTransform` mapping distance to visual properties) is perfectly preserved in `BannerCard`, avoiding `preserve-3d` bugs.

### 2.2. Architectural & Data Layer Status (Status: Missing)

While the visual shell and client-side logic (Zustand stores for Cart and UI state) are robust, the application is currently a static shell.

- **Dummy Data Reliance**: The entire application (Home, Browse, Cart, Checkout, Booking) is powered by local dummy data located in `apps/web/lib/dummy-products.ts`.
- **Supabase Missing**: There is currently no Supabase client setup in the web app (`apps/web/lib/supabase` does not exist).
- **Phase 3 (Authentication)**: Entirely missing. The PRD mandates Phone OTP and Google OAuth, but there are no functional login flows.

## 3. Implementation Strategy (Next Steps)

To bridge the gap between the completed UI shell and a functional application, the following phased approach is required:

### Phase A: Core Infrastructure Wiring

1.  **Supabase Client Setup**: Create server and browser clients in `apps/web/lib/supabase/`.
2.  **Environment Variables**: Ensure `.env.local` is populated with `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`.

### Phase B: Authentication (Phase 3 Catch-up)

1.  Build the Supabase Auth flows (OTP/Google).
2.  Implement session management via a global AuthProvider.
3.  Protect necessary routes (checkout, account, booking) via Next.js Middleware.

### Phase C: Data Migration (Replacing Dummy Data)

1.  **E-Commerce (Phase 4)**: Refactor `ProductsPage` and `ProductDetailPage` to fetch from the Supabase `products` and `categories` tables using React Server Components.
2.  **Search**: Replace the local array filtering in `SearchModal` with queries against the `tsvector` index in Supabase.
3.  **Checkout & Booking (Phases 5 & 7)**: Wire up the forms to submit data to the `orders` and `bookings` tables respectively.

## 4. Verification

- Verify all dummy files (`lib/dummy-products.ts`) can be safely deleted without breaking the UI.
- Verify Supabase RLS policies block unauthorized read/writes during the transition.
