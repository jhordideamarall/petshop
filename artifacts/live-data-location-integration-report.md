# Phase 4: Live Data & Location Integration Report

## Context
Transitioning the Home Page from static dummy data to live Supabase data and activating browser-based location detection in the Header. This enables a dynamic, personalized experience where users see real products and their actual location name.

## File Manifest
- `apps/web/lib/services/product-client.ts` (Created)
- `apps/web/app/(shop)/page.tsx` (Modified)
- `apps/web/components/layout/header.tsx` (Modified)
- `packages/core/src/services/location-service.ts` (Created)
- `packages/core/src/index.ts` (Created)
- `packages/core/package.json` (Modified)

## Surgical Breakdown

### 1. Live Product Integration
- **File**: `apps/web/app/(shop)/page.tsx`
- **Change**: Replaced the static `ALL_PRODUCTS` array with a `useQuery` hook fetching from `getActiveProducts`.
- **Logic**:
    - **Best Offer**: Dynamically filters products with a `promo_price` > 0.
    - **Semua Produk**: Displays all active products in descending order of creation.
    - **Loading States**: Added skeleton pulses and a centralized loader to prevent layout shifts.

### 2. Header Location Detection
- **File**: `apps/web/components/layout/header.tsx`
- **Change**: Integrated the browser Geolocation API.
- **Logic**: On mount, the app requests the user's coordinates, which are then passed to a reverse geocoding service.
- **Service**: Created `location-service.ts` in `@petshop/core` using the Nominatim OpenStreetMap API to translate coordinates into city names (e.g., "Jakarta Selatan", "Bandung").

### 3. Core Package Standardization
- **File**: `packages/core/package.json`
- **Change**: Added `.` (root) export to the package configuration.
- **Rationale**: Enables clean imports like `import { getCityFromCoords } from '@petshop/core'` across the monorepo.

## Validation
- **Type Check**: Ran `pnpm type-check` and successfully passed (6/6 packages).
- **Geolocation**: Verified that the app handles permission denials or errors by falling back to "Jakarta Selatan" gracefully.
- **Database**: Verified that deleting or updating a product in Supabase reflects immediately on the Home Page after a refresh/cache invalidation.

## Next Steps
- **Search Page Integration**: Update the `/products` and `/search` pages to use the same `product-client` service.
- **Booking Flow Finalization**: Fetch real pet data for the logged-in user in the booking checkout.
