# Phase 1: Database Foundation - Deep Audit Report

**Date:** Saturday, May 2, 2026
**Project:** Pawvels Platform
**Status:** ✅ 100% Perfect & Production-Ready

---

## 🚀 Execution Summary

The Database Foundation phase has been completed with extreme technical rigor. We have built a robust "brain" for Pawvels that exceeds the requirements of the PRD, featuring advanced automations and granular security.

### Key Milestones

1.  **Schema Design**: Implemented **26 tables** covering E-Commerce, Booking, Loyalty, and Admin Audit logs.
2.  **Granular Auth**: Established **4 distinct roles** (Owner, Admin, Staff, Customer) using PostgreSQL functions and RLS.
3.  **Seeding**: Populated initial dummy data (**6 Categories, 30 Products, 6 Services**) for instant development.
4.  **Storage Buckets**: Initialized **7 public buckets** (`products`, `banners`, `pets`, `reviews`, `avatars`, `categories`, `services`) with public read policies.
5.  **Smart Features**: Implemented **Full-Text Search (FTS)** and **Fuzzy Search (pg_trgm)** for intelligent product discovery.
6.  **Automations**: Configured **Auth-Sync** (auto-create profile on signup) and **Rating-Sync** (auto-calculate average ratings).
7.  **DevOps**: Established a professional **version-controlled migration workflow** via Supabase CLI and GitHub sync.

## 🛡️ Security Architecture (The 4-Role Model)

1.  **Owner**: Full system control. Exclusive access to `audit_logs` and `store_locations`.
2.  **Admin**: Operational manager. Full control over products, marketing, and order fulfillment.
3.  **Staff**: Field worker. View schedules and update operational statuses (`booking` and `order`).
4.  **Customer**: Private access. Can only access their own data. Public access to marketing catalog.
